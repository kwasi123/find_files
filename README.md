# find_files

This repo contains code that helps locate files on your PC

How It Works
You run python or python3 find_files.py file_extension (e.g .txt) path_to_files (e.g /root/Desktop)
After running this the program locates all files with the provided extension from the provided path
and stores it in a file called file_path.txt.
